Sure, here is an example VBA script that updates an Excel chart in PowerPoint:

vb
Copy code
Sub UpdateChart()

    Dim pptApp As PowerPoint.Application
    Dim pptPres As PowerPoint.Presentation
    Dim pptSlide As PowerPoint.Slide
    Dim chartObj As Object
    Dim chartData As Excel.ChartObject
    Dim chartRange As Excel.Range
    Dim chartFilePath As String
    Dim chartFileName As String
    
    ' Set the path and filename of the Excel chart
    chartFilePath = "C:\Charts\"
    chartFileName = "Chart1.xlsx"
    
    ' Get the PowerPoint application and presentation
    Set pptApp = GetObject(, "PowerPoint.Application")
    Set pptPres = pptApp.ActivePresentation
    
    ' Get the slide with the chart
    Set pptSlide = pptPres.Slides(1) ' Replace 1 with the slide index
    
    ' Get the chart object and data range
    Set chartObj = pptSlide.Shapes("Chart1") ' Replace "Chart1" with the name of your chart shape
    Set chartData = chartObj.Chart
    Set chartRange = chartData.ChartData.Workbook.Sheets(1).Range("A1:B4") ' Replace "A1:B4" with the range of your chart data
    
    ' Open the Excel file
    Dim xlApp As Excel.Application
    Dim xlWorkbook As Excel.Workbook
    Set xlApp = New Excel.Application
    Set xlWorkbook = xlApp.Workbooks.Open(chartFilePath & chartFileName)
    
    ' Update the chart data
    chartRange.Value = xlWorkbook.Sheets(1).Range("A1:B4").Value ' Replace "A1:B4" with the range of your chart data in the Excel file
    
    ' Close the Excel file
    xlWorkbook.Close False
    xlApp.Quit
    
    ' Update the chart in PowerPoint
    chartData.Refresh
    
    ' Clean up
    Set chartRange = Nothing
    Set chartData = Nothing
    Set chartObj = Nothing
    Set pptSlide = Nothing
    Set pptPres = Nothing
    Set pptApp = Nothing
    
End Sub
In this example, we first set the path and filename of the Excel chart that we want to update. We then get a reference to the PowerPoint application, presentation, and slide that contains the chart using the GetObject and Slides properties of the PowerPoint application and presentation objects.

Next, we get a reference to the chart object and data range using the Shapes and ChartData properties of the PowerPoint slide object and the ChartObject and Workbook properties of the chart object. We also open the Excel file using the Application and Workbook objects of the Excel application.

We then update the chart data by setting the value of the chart range to the value of the corresponding range in the Excel file. We also refresh the chart data in PowerPoint using the Refresh method of the chart object.

Finally, we clean up by setting all objects to Nothing. Note that you may need to adjust the code to match the names and ranges of your specific chart and data.
